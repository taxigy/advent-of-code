# [Day 16: Permutation Promenade](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/16)

## Part 1

You come upon a very unusual sight; a group of programs here appear to be dancing.

There are sixteen programs in total, named a through p. They start by standing in a line: a stands in position 0, b stands in position 1, and so on until p, which stands in position 15.

The programs' dance consists of a sequence of dance moves:

- Spin, written sX, makes X programs move from the end to the front, but maintain their order otherwise. (For example, s3 on abcde produces cdeab).
- Exchange, written xA/B, makes the programs at positions A and B swap places.
- Partner, written pA/B, makes the programs named A and B swap places.

For example, with only five programs standing in a line (abcde), they could do the following dance:

- s1, a spin of size 1: eabcd.
- x3/4, swapping the last two programs: eabdc.
- pe/b, swapping programs e and b: baedc.

After finishing their dance, the programs end up in order baedc.

You watch the dance for a while and record their dance moves (your puzzle input). In what order are the programs standing after their dance?

### Solved

Spin, in this case, it right-rotation of a sequence, think right shift. To do this, we should drop n items from the initial sequence and add them to its head:

```clojure
(defn rotate-right [v n]
  (let [q (- (count v) n)]
    (vec (concat (drop q v)
                 (take q v)))))
```

Exchange and partner operations are element swap, where the former points at items by index and the latter requires lookup by value:

```clojure
(defn swap [v i j]
  (assoc v j (v i) i (v j)))

(defn swap-vals [v x y]
  (let [i (.indexOf v x)
        j (.indexOf v y)]
    (swap v i j)))
```

The input we have is a comma-separated one row of 10k operations. Let's split it:

```clojure
(def input
  (-> "input.txt"
      slurp
      (clojure.string/split #",")))
```

Now, we have operations like "s1", "x3/4" and "pe/b" as each item in `input` collection.

In case of "spin", we simply need to parse the number. In case of "exchange" and "partner", split the string by "/" character and parse values. And in all cases, the first character in the string, after we check it, doesn't matter.

Working with strings and collection in one function looks a bit ugly in Clojure, but here's the code:

```clojure
(defn parse-num [s]
  (->> s
       rest
       clojure.string/join
       read-string))

(defn parse-nums [s]
  (->> s
       rest
       clojure.string/join
       (re-seq #"\d+")
       (map read-string)))

(defn parse-vals [s]
  (->> s
       rest
       clojure.string/join
       (re-seq #"[a-p]")
       (map first)))
```

We have transformation functions per operation kind, now let's make a transformation function that takes input vector and the operation as a string, applies the latter, and returns the resulting vector:

```clojure
(defn transform [v op]
  (case (first op)
    \s (rotate-right v (parse-num op))
    \x (apply swap v (parse-nums op))
    \p (apply swap-vals v (parse-vals op))
    :default v))
```

So, the final calculation function would look like this:

```clojure
(defn calculate [input]
  (loop [ops input
         result (vec "abcdefghijklmnop")]
    (if (empty? ops)
      (clojure.string/join result)
      (recur (rest ops)
             (transform result (first ops))))))
```
